# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis: 
### The purpose of this analysis was to analyize the  testing results from a large number of schools in a state. The test results encompassed both reading and math scores from the grades of 9 through 12. The goal of this analysis was to remove the scores for a specific school and see how that would affect the data. We also found the passing percentage and see if there was any correlation with the budget per student.  

## Results: 

#### The district overall average has been lowered due to Thomas going down significantly.

## How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?

## Summary:
### Overall from the analysis we can see that removing the 9th grade test scores negatively impacted the scholls results. their passing percent for reading and math both went down significantly.
